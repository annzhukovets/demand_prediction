# Demand Prediction Project
## Description
The Demand Prediction project aims to assist a fashion retailer in predicting the success of certain products compared to others. By leveraging current sales patterns and product properties, the retailer can make informed decisions about re-ordering a second batch of products during the season. The key objective is to determine if it is possible to detect products that have higher potential for success and whether investing in them is a profitable strategy.
